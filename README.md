Student Project Management Console (Java + SQL)

Hi everyone! I’m excited to share one of our recent collaborative projects — A console-based Student Project Management System, developed by my teammate Ramkamal and me using Core Java and MySQL.

Tech Stack Used:

1.Core Java for backend logic and OOP-based structure

2.JDBC for database integration

3.MySQL for data management

4.Eclipse IDE for development and testing

Objective:
This application was designed to assist department project coordinators in organizing and managing student project details. Key functionalities include adding new teams, searching by batch or student name, updating weekend reports, tracking review attendance and displaying team-wise project data — all via a simple and intuitive console interface.

Scope:
Although initially developed for academic use, this system can easily be extended to support workflows like internship monitoring, mini-project submissions, or department-level record-keeping — making it adaptable for various institutional needs.

Personal Takeaway:
Working as a team helped us divide responsibilities effectively while deepening our technical skills. Personally, I strengthened my Core Java fundamentals, OOP design principles, and hands-on experience with JDBC and database interaction.

Huge thanks to my teammate Ramkamal for the collaboration and support throughout the project!

We’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.
